				<h3>HPR-1 &middot; UPCOMING</h3>
				<p>This project was one of the first conceived in the Makers Club - a rocket designed to reach Level 1 certification from the National Association of Rocketry. Due to other projects being prioritized, this project has remained in progress and yet to be completed.</p>

				<p>Being level 1 certified would allow us to purchase H and I motors, which are more powerful than anything available to us without certification. This would allow us to pursue even more advanced rocketry projects in the future.</p>

				<h3>HPR-2 &middot; COMPLETED</h3>
				<p>This rocket, and its many iterations, was our entry for the Team America Rocketry Challenge in 2015.</p>
