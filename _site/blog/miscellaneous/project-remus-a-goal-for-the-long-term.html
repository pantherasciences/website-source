    <h2>Project Remus: A Goal for the Long Term</h2>
    <p><em>By Josh Eiland</em> &middot; January 21, 2014</p>

      <p>Hello Everyone - Welcome to Panthera Sciences. Whether you heard about us from The Lovett School, or found us some other way, we appreciate your visit.</p>

<p>I’m Josh Eiland, and, together with Nick Becker, we recently founded what we have come to call “Panthera Sciences.” We are basically devoted to brainstorming and executing any experiment that we find intriguing and (somewhat) plausible, our first of which we have entitled “Romulus” and “Remus.” All future projects will be documented through the Panthera website.</p>

<p>Though Romulus has been successfully progressing through the research and design phases as a project of The Lovett School’s Makers Club, I would like to primarily dedicate this post to our newest idea:</p>

<p><strong>Project Remus</strong></p>

<p>Nick and I decided recently to initiate this long-term project to begin exploring the idea of researching, designing, and, if everything falls into place, potentially building a CubeSat.</p>

<p>&lt;– Image –&gt;</p>

<p>The basic concept and design of the CubeSat was created in 1999 by professors and student-led teams from Stanford University and California Polytechnic State University. A “CubeSat” is, as the name implies, a small cube-shaped satellite, with the standard dimensions being 10cm X 10cm X 10cm.</p>

<p>Several CubeSats have been constructed by different universities, private companies, and even independent hobbyists since its first orbit led by the Stanford and Cal Poly teams in 2003. The CubeSats are typically released in a “pod” of three into orbit, and many have tracking devices that allow anyone to see exactly where they are at a given time. For example, at the following URL: http://www.n2yo.com/?s=99902, you can see the location of the CubeSat developed by a team from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJ3Sat), the first ever satellite in history successfully sent into orbit by high school students.</p>

<p>Nick and I plan to gather ideas from the TJ3Sat and other commercial and educational CubeSat programs to incorporate ideas that have been successful in the past, in addition to unique new ideas, in our CubeSat project. Our primary goal is to explore this incredible innovation that has been made possible by our ever-advancing technological society, and to spark interest in aerospace exploration inside of our high school and beyond.</p>

<p>Though we have not yet drafted an official time-frame for the sequence of events going forward, we hope to have completed the research phase and begin drafting design ideas by late this spring, and if we are able to raise enough money, we will hopefully be able to turn this inspiration into a concrete project.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting our website and demonstrating interest in Project Remus and Panthera Sciences.</p>

<p>The model will also draw influences from the <a href="http://www.tjhsst.edu/students/activities/tj3sat/">TJ3SAT</a>, which was designed by high school students in a group at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science &amp; Technology. This project was completed in 2013 and is currently in orbit after 7 years of work among the schools’ students and faculty sponsors, along with help from partners including NASA and Orbital Sciences.</p>

<p>Panthera Sciences aims to develop a design similar to past projects but to also utilize unique new features to improve the scope and versatility of the satellite, allowing it to explore new horizons of this ever-developing technology.</p>

<h2 id="project-remus-has-been-divided-into-five-major-phases">Project Remus has been divided into five major phases:</h2>

<p><strong>1. Research / Design</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Feasibility Study Into the Use of 3D Printed Materials in CubeSat Flight Missions - Daniel Fluitt California Polytechnic State University</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Fundraising</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Panthera hopes to gain fundraising for this Cubesat project primarily through the generous members of The Lovett School community and aerospace programs that offer funds for this type of project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Construction</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After the design and fundraising processes have been completed, and a final design and parts list have been established, we will actually order the different parts, which we have outlined below:</p>

    <p><strong>Components</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Structure</li>
      <li>Solar Panels</li>
      <li>Antenna(s)</li>
      <li>Payload</li>
      <li>Flight Control</li>
      <li>Electrical Power Subsystem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Testing</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. Execution</strong></p>

<p>Down the road, we hope to launch Project Remus through the NASA Educational Launch of Nanosatellites <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/elana/#.Ut_tkuso7rk">(ELaNa)</a> program, through which NASA’s Launch Services Program partners with outside groups to launch different types of satellite projects.</p>

<p>By developing a partnership with the professionals working in this program we can learn more about the progress in the CubeSat technologies and successfully accomplish our goals in this project.</p>

<p>We plan on completing the Design and Research phase by the end of the year.</p>
