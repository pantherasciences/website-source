We are proud to announce that the Lovett Makers Club has won the best video category in the Global Space Balloon Challenge for 2015! Over 300 teams registered from 48 countries, and we are very proud of our accomplishment. As you know from our previous blog posts, this balloon launch was a huge success, and we were able to make an incredible video. In case you missed our previous blog posts, here is the award winning video for your viewing pleasure.

A huge thanks goes out to James Kolsby, our videographer extraordinaire and the founder of the Makers Club,  to our entire team credited at the end of the video, to our mentors Jim Wingate and Karl Hwang, and to the Global Space Balloon Challenge for being our initial inspiration to begin high altitude balloon projects.

For winning, we will receive a number of prizes, including an Eagle Flight Computer from High Altitude Science. This flight computer will be an essential part of our future balloon projects - it combines an unlocked GPS receiver (reports from up to 260,000ft) with an easy to use interface for connecting sensors. The flight computer records data from sensors and the GPS to a microSD card automatically. Additionally, we will receive 3 Arduinos, and 3 balloons from SSTL - one 500g and two 300g. These balloons are significantly smaller than what we have used in the past, but we will be able to use them for some fun projects over the next year. You can see the full list of winners in all categories [here](https://balloonchallenge.org/winners).

More than anything, winning this prize demonstrates that although we are only a group of high school students, we have the capability to go head to head against college students and aerospace professionals from around the world. We could not be more excited for both our upcoming LunarHAB project as well as our next entry in GSBC.
