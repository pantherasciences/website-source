On May 2nd as we launched our 3rd high altitude balloon as our entry in the Global Space Balloon Challenge, James Kolsby, the founder of the Makers Club, captured video, and he has since edited it and created this video. We used a Panasonic GH4, GoPro Hero 4 Black, Hero 2, and DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ quadcopter for the footage included in the video.

Here is the final masterpiece. We hope you and the GSBC judges enjoy it as much as we do.
