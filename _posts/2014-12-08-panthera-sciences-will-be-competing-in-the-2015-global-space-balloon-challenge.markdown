We are proud to announce that we will be leading the Lovett Makers Club team in the 2015 Global Space Balloon Challenge! Due to the success of HAB-1, we are now ready to begin preparing for our next high altitude balloon. We are currently in the preliminary design phase and are discussing potential goals of the project with the Makers Club.
