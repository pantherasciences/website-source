This past Sunday the Lovett Makers Club held it's largest event to date. The morning included the launch of our second balloon in preparation for the Global Space Balloon Challenge and two rocket launches in preparation for TARC.

In summary, we saw an improvement in stability and altitude from Launch Test 1. This week we plan to carry out a complete redesign of the payload stage to decrease the mass of the rocket even further. Details on exactly how much weight is taken off will be included in the next update following our qualification flight.

Meanwhile, the Makers Club will be rebuilding the payload stage from scratch. Everyone is looking forward to the qualification flights this Sunday!
