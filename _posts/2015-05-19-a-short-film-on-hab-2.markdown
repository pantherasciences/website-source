On Sunday, March 15 Panthera Sciences and the Lovett Makers Club launched our second high altitude balloon. Cole Johnson was kind enough to film and produce a video covering the launch and flight of HAB-2.

The following was shot with a Canon 6D, GoPro Hero 4 Black, Hero 3 Black, Hero 2, and Phantom 2 Vision + quadcopter. See [colejoh.com](http://colejoh.com) for more of his work.
