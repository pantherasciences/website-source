Last saturday the Lovett Makers Club successfully launched and recovered our first prototype rocket designed for the 2015 Team America Rocketry Challenge. As a whole, the launch was extremely successful. The rocket reached an altitude of 585 feet and was in flight for approximately 40 seconds. Furthermore, the rocket was recovered with no damage - including the egg concealed in its payload!

The [full launch report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVRhNIz3oMDIJUgBt09PYpfolZdJp-lkBkILZ4aiJcc/pub) and pictures from last Saturday are included below:
