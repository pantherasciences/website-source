As we’ve kicked into full-swing with our work on the conclusion in our HAB series, we’ve seen participation and interest among underclassmen swell to exciting new heights. Dividing the tasks into sub-groups based upon skillset and interests, our current layout is as follows:


**Redesign datalogger**

* SD Logger
* I2C & Analog sensor testing
* Calculate Current Drawn

**Test Cameras in low light (sunset)**

* Take some pictures/video during sunset and see how they turn out

**Test Battery endurance**

* Simulate a launch duration and evaluate battery life afterwards

**Test “Trackability” and “Recoverability”**

* Have one team drop the hab off in a secret location
* Have another team track it via ham radio and spot and recover it

**Possible capsule redesign (Lighter weight, less drag, more stable, etc)**

* Only if extra time or very apparent need

**Streamline Launch Procedures**

* Launch Itinerary
* Checklist

**Register for FAA Clearance**

* Sooner rather than later
* Josh will file HIBAL with Mr. Smith


We have set our official launch date as May 20th, with a tentative launch time of 6:00am. Our currently planned location is 125 Distribution Drive, McDonough, GA 30252 (33.399349, -84.133097), but it is subject to change if we are not able to sort out permissions to use the area. Our backup site will be Lake Allatoona, where we launched our HAB-3 entry to the 2015 Global Space Balloon Challenge.
