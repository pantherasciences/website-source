Last Saturday, November 22 2014, Panthera Sciences in collaboration with the Lovett Makers Club launched our very first High Altitude Balloon.

Eastbound winds carried the balloon over 300 miles to Candor, North Carolina. The balloon was in the air for 5 hours and 23 minutes, and we predict it reached an altitude of over 85,000ft.

We will have a full write up covering the development, launch, and retrieval of the balloon by next week. We are also working on a longer cut of the video above.
